# Math Voice Test with pyttsx3

This project is a **test environment** for experimenting with offline voice output using **pyttsx3** and a basic math‑calculation engine.

It is **not** the full CORSPRITE system — only a lightweight test of:

- Offline text‑to‑speech  
- Basic math parsing

## 🔊 About CORSPRITE

**CORSPRITE** has its own advanced voice‑input and voice‑output models, along with a much more powerful math engine.

You can find the complete and improved CORSPRITE project here:

This repository is only a **test module** for experimenting with input & output logic.

## 🧮 What This Test Does

- Evaluates math expressions  
- Handles decimals, fractions, negatives, and parentheses  
- Produces step‑by‑step explanations  
- Speaks results aloud using **pyttsx3**  
- Uses a queued speech system (no overlapping audio)  
- No microphone or speech‑to‑text required  

Example:
Expression 1: 3+3*3
  Step 1: 3.0 * 3.0 = 9.0
[VOICE] Calculating 3 + 3  times  3. The final result is twelve.
  Step 2: 3.0 + 9.0 = 12.0
Final result: 12.0
